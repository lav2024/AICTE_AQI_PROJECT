# AICTE_AQI_PROJECT

# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes various environmental factors such as pollutant levels and meteorological data to provide accurate AQI predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and accuracy analysis
- Visualizations of AQI trends and predictions

## Dataset
The dataset consists of air pollution and weather-related parameters collected from various monitoring stations. It includes:
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- O3
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lav2024/AICTE_AQI_PROJECT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AICTE_AQI_PROJECT
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the `AIR QUALITY INDEX PREDICTION.ipynb` file step by step.
3. Analyze the results and visualizations.

## Model Performance
The project evaluates multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing one for AQI prediction. The performance metrics include:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results
The model provides AQI predictions with a reasonable accuracy, helping to understand pollution patterns and take preventive measures.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of deep learning models for better accuracy
- Inclusion of real-time AQI data streaming
- Development of a web-based dashboard for AQI visualization
